There are more than 1.3 million apps on the Google PlayStore & 1.2 million apps on the Apple AppStore. Yet only a few among these are applications
with amazing quality with almost perfect experience. In this blog I will try to explore things that these apps have that make them shine like crazy
diamonds from others.

*Disclaimer: The things I am going to suggest here are from my own personal experience. I do not have some success formula that you can apply.
If I did I wouldn't be here telling you guys any ways. <need to improve>*

## Social Integration

Smartphone users do not have time in the world to register for your App. So quit trying ask them to register. At max you can provide a
connect with FB / Twitter / G+ buttons with a tiny Signup button. These smartphone users are going to curse you even more if your application
provides are connect with FB button and it doesn't work. And please don't ask for more info from them once they allow you to access their
social networks basic info. Also don't try to trick the users by asking for more than just Basic Info if not needed.

## Sharing & App Extension

Well, there is some relief here on the Android side. The Intent sharing system that Android has is pretty open and works great. You can easily
send a picture from your gallery to a whatsapp user. But iOS applications still suck at this, 'app extensions' was launched with iOS in Oct-14,
but still isn't incorporated by applications like whatsapp.

## Rating Popups

Never ever, ever ever disturb a user's workflow. Don't show popups asking the user to rate the app. If he loves your work he will volunteer to
rate & review your app. I just love the way [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios) puts it *' 1Password never prompts you for a review because we love you. If you feel generous,
have a couple minutes, and could leave a review, it would mean the  world to us. Literally: \*the world\* '*. Here's a screenshot of something that could be done instead.

## Push Notification Spam (XYZ)

If your app sends notifications unnecessarily, you just wasted the user's time. Don't try to act over smart and score more usage time
by sending spams. The users will not admire this.
